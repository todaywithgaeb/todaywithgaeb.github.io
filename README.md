**What is BACKBURNER really all about?**

NIKI's song "Backburner" seems to be about a difficult and dysfunctional relationship in which a character knows they aren't being treated properly but finds it difficult to let go. The other person's attention is irresistible, even though they know they should be putting it on the back burner and are not a priority.


**𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒The first verse**

Even though they don't give much thought about what the other person wants, the narrator admits that talking to them feels good. They talk about their past together and how they overcame a challenging circumstance. The reference to "Asian Calvinism" can be interpreted as a reference to the rigorous religious and cultural upbringing they may have had. The narrator appears to be aware of their tendency to make bad decisions, fail to learn from them, and then pray to God to spare them from the consequences.

**𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒The pre chorus**

The narrator dismisses a band that the other person mentions in the pre-chorus, implying that they should likewise be forgotten. They can't help but acknowledge how much they miss the other person, though.

**Summarization˚˖𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒✧˚.🎀༘⋆**

The narrator's narrator struggles with a relationship, expressing mixed feelings and a fatalistic view of life. They acknowledge the other person's neediness and the narrator's struggle to resist them. Despite knowing they will be forgotten, they continue to hold onto hope for the other person's choice. The chorus acknowledges their own issues and their difficult family situation, while the outro emphasizes the sadness of settling for the backburner.
